# Snake_Game
Worked on this small project to try to add more projects to my portfolio.

# Methods
Using Java & JavaFX I was able to create this small retro game from my childhood.

I added losing conditions based on if the snake goes out of bounds or the snake eats itself

A fun small project that I did on my free time maybe I'll add some sounds effects and a winning condition later on.
